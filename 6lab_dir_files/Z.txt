ZAm I really hard to please?
Perhaps I have such special needs
I wondered what was wrong with me (haha)
My friends all fall so easily (pussies)
Called the first one Savage Mode, my mood, that's what it was (21)
2016, we was ridin' around, beatin' niggas up in the club
I know she around for the money, but act like she loyal, I don't feel the love (21)
I'm so rich, get bored, might wake up, buy me a car just 'cause (on God)
Her titties is hard 'cause she spent a five, my bitch titties cost me a dub (21)
All my bitches got BBLs, all my bitches got butts (straight up)
I ain't with the rap beef, Draco pedophile, all of my opps get touched (straight up)
We ain't never ran off on no barber, but we still be hoppin' out cuts (straight up)
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
I leave all my cars
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
All my opps be
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Wiped his nose, it was
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Savage never did no
That Clase for your wife (21), that hookah for your wife (pussy)
I'm Slaughter Gang, pussy, you know I brought my knife (21)
He was talkin' gangster (21), we caught him at a light (pussy)
I let my young nigga do it, it was free, he wanted a stripe (on God)
Havin' my way with the cheese, I'm in the den with the thieves (on God)
I know that she ratchet, I could tell by the way that she wearin' her weave (21)
Smokin' on Zaza, this shit came out the garden with Adam and Eve (21)
Chopper go fow-fow, shoot up your pow-wow, niggas tryna make y'all bleed (21)
Got out of line, spanked that baby, we had to rock him to sleep (pussy)
Is it a issue? Keep me a pistol, I ain't finna diss you (pussy)
All that pillow talk, I'ma have to send The Boogeyman to come get you
Chain hang low like a yo-yo, your bitch ridin' dick like pogo
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
I leave all my cars
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
All my opps be
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Wiped his nose, it was
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Savage never did no
21 Savage
